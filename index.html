            <h1>Rules of Tic Tac Toe</h1>
            <p>The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid</p>
            <p>In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. </p>
            <p>Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled.</p>
            <p>If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. </p>
            <p>If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.</p>
