Here, you have your typical memory game with a little spin...Michael Scott! The game is played with a total of 12 cards, 6 matches **AND** you have the option to match against the clock **OR** play at your own speed.  If you choose to play against the clock you will have 60 seconds to find all 6 matches.  Once all 6 matches are made a messsage will display letting the player know they won the game.

## MVP
********
- Randomly hide the cards face down 
- Add a timer that counts down from 60 seconds
- When a card is clicked it should flip and display an image
- The first card clicked should remain face-up on the second click, but if the first and second card are not a match, then both cards should flip back over
- If a match is made, both cards should remain face-up
-  Track the score/tally of matches and display on the board
